16 October 2000
+ Finished options menu.
+ Fix up documentation, hopefully do a freshmeat release.

15 October 2000
+ Added PCX Save/Load
+ Added NULL and NCURSES targets to svmwgraph.  I must be insane.

6 October 2000
+ Fixed off-by-one error in paintpro 6.0 format, making a new 6.1 release
+ Made sure backwards compatability available

30 September 2000
+ Rewrote vmw_paintpro.c vmwLoadPicPacked from scratch just about
+ Implemented vmwSavePicPacked
+ Wrote "ppro_view" in tools directory

25 September 2000
+ Closed most of the memory leaks

18 September 2000
+ Just about everything works now.

16 September 2000
+ Re-wrote completely libsvmwgraph... making it an actual lib,
  removing all sdl dependencies, added hooks so that any arbitrary
  graphics platform can be used.  This was lots of fun.
+ Split "tblib.c" up into about 20 component functions
+ Debugged the problems from the svmwgraph change.. suprisingly it
  was very few.
+ Started adding features that depended on the svmwgraph rewrite
+ Added load/save support!  Tracked down a nasty out-of-bounds
  error with coolbox.  Those type of errors are so hard to find in C...

12 September 2000
+ Added support for level2

4 September 2000
+ Have about 90% of the game running now on SDL.  What a fun
  way to spend labor day weekend.

1994-1996
  Wrote Tom Bombem in pascal and inline assembly, using the
  "Flying Toaster" demo from PCGPE as a starting point.
  Used Ethan Brodsky's sound libs, in addition to my own
  "Paintpro" graphics program/loader.
