28 October 2001
+ Debugged over a few days 32bpp solaris support, with lots of help 
  from G. Low <unix@macrosscity.com>  

2 June 2001
+ Made a super fancy level2 level editor.  it's in the ./tools directory.
+ Verified that tb1 will in fact compile and run under windows with
  the cygwin utils.

? April 2001
+ Added some minimal joypad support

11 November 2000
+ Got opengl sorta working, when I should be working on my 
  OS project involving semaphores.  Oops.

2 November 2000
+ Continued re-writing the level_1 engine that I started last week.
+ Re-wrote frame limiter.  Managed to make it a lot less jumpy.

28 October 2000
+ Finished porting the Level2->Level3 cut-scenes
+ Really crude level3 engine.

27 October 2000
+ Started writing an opengl target.  Was hoping for a cool tb1 rotating
  on the side of a cube type deal.  Had some fights with glut and decided
  to put that off for a while.
+ Modularized the makefiles.  Now just edit Makefile.inc.... and you
  can compile without SDL_mixer/curses/SDL, etc... though you sacrifice
  functionality
+ TB1 works over an ssh connection in curses [BSD-Curses] on a VT102 terminal
  on a Solaris Ultrasparc machine!  I can even get to level2!


19 October 2000
+ Fixed some other minor bugs.
+ Added "vmwLine" to svmwgraph.  Really it's just a port of the PCGPE line
  routine.  I should write one of my own.

18 October 2000
+ No e-mails from freshmeat submission, so I suppose that means all is well.
+ Fixed bug where ppro_view only ran in curses mode
+ Fixed bug where double/fullscreen were reversed on options menu
+ Fixed bug where "to be continued" displayed improperly.
+ Fix bug in handling of spaces in names in high score list

16 October 2000
+ Finished options menu.
+ Fix up documentation, hopefully do a freshmeat release.

15 October 2000
+ Added PCX Save/Load
+ Added NULL and NCURSES targets to svmwgraph.  I must be insane.

6 October 2000
+ Fixed off-by-one error in paintpro 6.0 format, making a new 6.1 release
+ Made sure backwards compatability available

30 September 2000
+ Rewrote vmw_paintpro.c vmwLoadPicPacked from scratch just about
+ Implemented vmwSavePicPacked
+ Wrote "ppro_view" in tools directory

25 September 2000
+ Closed most of the memory leaks

18 September 2000
+ Just about everything works now.

16 September 2000
+ Re-wrote completely libsvmwgraph... making it an actual lib,
  removing all sdl dependencies, added hooks so that any arbitrary
  graphics platform can be used.  This was lots of fun.
+ Split "tblib.c" up into about 20 component functions
+ Debugged the problems from the svmwgraph change.. suprisingly it
  was very few.
+ Started adding features that depended on the svmwgraph rewrite
+ Added load/save support!  Tracked down a nasty out-of-bounds
  error with coolbox.  Those type of errors are so hard to find in C...

12 September 2000
+ Added support for level2

4 September 2000
+ Have about 90% of the game running now on SDL.  What a fun
  way to spend labor day weekend.

24 June 2000
+ Started converting to the SDL lib.  Got the title screen up

1994-1996
  Wrote Tom Bombem in pascal and inline assembly, using the
  "Flying Toaster" demo from PCGPE as a starting point.
  Used Ethan Brodsky's sound libs, in addition to my own
  "Paintpro" graphics program/loader.
