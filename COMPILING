First you have to get the ggi graphics library.
  * for newest updates/info check out http://www.ggi-project.org
  * Get a new snapshot from ftp://synergy.caltech.edu/pub/ggi/ggi-snapshots
  * Get a newer one --> I developed it with ggi-980226.tar.gz
  * save it
  * uncompress it "tar -xzvf ggi-980226.tar.gz"
  * "cd ggi" "cd lib" "cd libggi" "make"
  * this brings up a menu.  be sure to choose "xserv","svga" and "mem"
    you can choose others if you wish, but these are all needed.
  * exit the menu
  * "make"
  * should compile w/o problems [hopefully]
  * "su" "make install"
  * link your ~/ggi/include/ggi directory to /usr/local/include/ggi
    [or however you want to get the files in the right place]
  * copy the files ~/ggi/lib/libggi/include/ggi/*.h into
    /usr/local/include/ggi
  * should be all set up
  
Now compile TB1
  * Uncompress the .tar.gz file
  * "make"
  * all should go OK.. you will get errors on some of the sound stuff,
    but as long as the "tb1" file is created, you are good to go.
  * It is known to work under 8bpp and 16bpp x-targets.  Let me know if
    it doesn't work under all of them
