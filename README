For now, just compiling info.

You need the SDL game development library, 1.1.3 or newer:
   http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.1.html   
   
You also need the "SDL_mixer library" from   
   http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html   

To compile SDL_Mixer you need the smpeg library:
   http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3

Then a "make" should compile it.
