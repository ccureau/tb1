Finish the game:
Requires:
  Levels3-10.  Level 3 is semi-done in pascal.

Other aspirations:
   Some sort of "configure" type file
   Audit all the code.
   Finish plugging mem leaks [still need to fix level_1 and level_2].
   Change all screen-shifts to fades like in original?
   Implement level editor

SVMWGraph todo:
   Color Averaging in the curses target?
   Implement non 320x200x8 PCX loading?
