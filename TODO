Finish the game:
Requires:
  Levels3-10.  Level 3 is semi-done in pascal.

Other aspirations:
   Some sort of "configure" type file
   Audit all the code.
   Finish plugging mem leaks [still need to fix level_1 and level_2].
   Change all screen-shifts to fades like in original?
   Implement level editor

SVMWGraph todo:
   Color Averaging in the curses target?
   Implement non 320x200x8 PCX loading?
   Make sprite code RLE?
   
Known Bugs:
   8bpp palette switching not as smooth as it could be.
   Volume controls on option menu don't do anything yet
   I get higher FPS on a 486 than my k6-2+!  Need to figure this out.
   Frame limited code is limited.  Need to think about this some more.
